# Python-Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Line


According to Body Mass Index (BMI) The average weights of healthy body for the corresponding heights was given in the following table. The aim was to find a linear regression line for the relationship between height and weight, and correlation coefficient for the relationship. So I create two list h and w for the data that was given. I then found a python function to find the line of best fit. I will find m and b such that where m is slope and b is y-intercept of the line in  y = mx + b. 


# The Model And Discussion On Accuricy Of The Model
When we apply line of best fit function (bestFitLine()) the model is

w=4.024h-132.22

where h is the height of health body and w is corresponding weight of the body.

And, when we apply correlation coeffcient function (corrCoefficient()) we find correlation coeffcient which is

r=0.9997

That is very close to 1. Which means the model is very strong, almost perfect and positive.
