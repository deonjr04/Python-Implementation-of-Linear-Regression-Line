# Python-Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Line


According to Body Mass Index (BMI) The average weights of healthy body for the corresponding heights was given in the following table. The aim was to find a linear regression line for the relationship between height and weight, and correlation coefficient for the relationship. So I create two list h and w for the data that was given. I then found a python function to find the line of best fit. I will find m and b such that where m is slope and b is y-intercept of the line in  y = mx + b.
